								The city of Jabalpur has witnessed several historical events, memoirs in which transports a tourist back in time and is sure to fuel the explorer within. Jabalpur is
said to be named after saint Jabali Rishi. In Arabic, the word Jabal means mountains. So there is a possibility that the name of the city is also derived from here.
This city was the capital of Tripura Kingdom in the 10th century and was ruled by the Hayahya. Many relics from the reign of King Ashoka were discovered in here.
In the 16th century, the city was ruled by the Gonds and then taken over by the Marathas in the 17th century. The British defeated the Marathas in the 19th
century and made Jabalpur the headquarter of Nerbudda territories. It also became the capital of Saugor which is the present day Sagar District and Nerbudda
District. After Independence, the cantonment in the city was dedicated to army training and a vehicle factory and a gun carriage factory were also established.
Once a part of the Gond empire, the history of Jabalpur, inspired by gures like Rani Durgavati is a strong evidence of the strength of Indian women. Jabalpur not
only mesmerizes us through the beauty of the Kalachuri art and unique constructions like the Madan Mahal Fort but also reminds of the sacrice of Mahatma
Gandhi whose remains were immersed in the Narmada in Tilwara Ghat amidst pure marble on both sides. A great deal of importance was given to make this city
a famous tourist destination.

	Located on the banks of river Narmada, the city of Jabalpur houses several mesmerizing gifts of nature and never fails to amaze a tourist. From the spectacular
route of the Narmada, through the shape- shifting marble canyon to the Dhuandhar falls at Bedhaghat, or the Balancing rock which is known to withstand
earthquakes of magnitude as high as 6.5, Jabalpur is a reection of the strength and beauty of nature. The amazing creations like the Dumna Nature Reserve Park
maintain this industrial city's connection with nature and are certain to ignite imaginations in the busy minds and create a sense of relaxation and rejuvenation.

	<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Mythology</span><br><br><br>
	There are quite a few mythical stories and legends attached to the history and origination of Omkareshwar. The rst one goes to say that Vindhya- the deity
controlling the Vindhyachal mountain ranges was worshipping Lord Shiva to cleanse his soul of the sins committed by him. He made a lingam of sand and clay.
Impressed by the worship, Lord Shiva appeared before him in two forms- Omkareshwar and Amkareshwar. The second legend suggests that an ancestor of Lord
Ram- King Mandhata, worshipped Lord Shiva to the extent that the God appeared and manifested himself in the form of Jyotirlinga. Another Hindu myth says that
once during the ancient times, there was a war between the Devas(gods) and Danavs(demons), in which the Devas lost the battle to the Danavs. Disappointed by
the failure, the Devas prayed to Lord Shiva, who impressed by their faith and devotion, appeared in the form of Jyotirlinga and defeated the Danavs.
