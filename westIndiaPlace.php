the Rann Festival is held during December-February everywhere in which there are huge camp settlements with cultural programs, functions and adventure
activities like hot-air ballooning. Kutch is also among the largest district of India with a terribly low population density. Also, Kutch lies on the India-Pakistan
border and you can see parts of Pakistan from Kutch. Kutch is also famous for crafts and embroidery works, Flamingo Sanctuary and Wild Ass Sanctuary. Bhuj

								The history of Kutch dates back to prehistoric times. There have been traces found, of its existence, in the Indus Valley sites. Alexander mentioned the town in his
early writings. It was ruled by the Greeks before it nally fell in the hands of the Mauryan Empire. For the next few centuries, Kutch was ruled by a number of
dynasties including Western Satraps, Guptas, Chavdas, Chalukyas and the Jadega brothers. The ancestors of the last ruler Rayadhan II, also found Kathiawar. In
1819, owing to a defeat in a battle, Kutch came under the jurisdiction of the British. When India attained independence, Kutch became a ?dominion of India? and
was declared a separate state 1950. In 1956, it was merged with Bombay state. Finally, when the two states of Maharashtra and Gujarat were formed in 1960,
Kutch came to be a part of the latter.

	The history of the city of Mumbai, or Bombay, began with the signing of the Treaty of Bassein between Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and the Portuguese, who
were oered the seven islands that made up Bombay by the Sultan. The islands were initially referred to by several dierent names, but collectively took the
written name of Bombain. The Portuguese built several churches and forts in the city during their reign. With its growing strategic importance as a natural
harbour, it attracted repeated British and Dutch interests. In 1661, as part of the royal marriage alliance between Charles II of England and Princess Catherine of
Portugal, the islands were given as dowry to the British by the Portuguese. In 1668, the English leased 3 of the islands to the British East India Company, and a few
years later, they shifted their capital from Surat to Bombay. Bombay was thus the capital of the Bombay Presidency and quickly gained commercial and military
signicance. The Portuguese nally left Bombay in the 1730s, following their defeat to the Marathas under Peshwa Baji Rao. Following the Anglo-Maratha war and
the signing of some treaties, the British drove out the Marathas and were able to establish their majoritarian supremacy over Bombay. Under the Hornby Vellard
project, the islands were unied through signicant land reclamation activities into a single landmass. Bombay was extremely active in the political sphere during
India?s independence struggle and was part of the Quit India Movement & the Royal Navy Mutiny in the 1940s.
