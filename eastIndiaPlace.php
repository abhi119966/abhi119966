									<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History of Bodh Gaya</span><br><br><br>
								Anciently known as Uruwela, Bodhgaya was situated on the banks of river Nerajana, now known as river Lilajan. King Ashoka is believed to have built the rst
temple on the land. As per theory, Buddha was born in 563 BC in a land which now belongs to Nepal, on the auspicious night of Baisakhi Purnima. Born as the
son of a king, Prince Siddhartha renounced his world possessions at the age of 29 and travelled far and wide in search of the eternal truth. After observing selfmortication for 6 years, he did not attain Vimukthi so he gave up the practice. He then discovered the Eightfold path which freed him from lust, hatred and
delusion and thus attained enlightenment or ?Buddhatva?. The tree under which he gained enlightenment is the renowned Bodhi tree. He gained numerous
followers in the days to follow and the village turned into a pilgrimage centre. Emperor Ashoka himself was one of his biggest disciples and he built the famous
Mahabodhi temple. The sacred village gained momentum around the 13th century and plenty of shrines and temples were built. But soon after the area fell into
the hands of the brutal Turkish emperors and they ransacked the city. The British rule later restored the city to its pure sacred form. At present, the city is one of
the most important Buddhist pilgrim sites and is declared as world heritage site by UNESCO.<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">The City of Enlightenment</span><br><br><br>
	Situated on the banks of river Neranjana, Bodh is a holy city in the state of Bihar. A UNESCO World Heritage Site today, Bodh was the place where Lord Buddha
attained enlightenment and earned the name Bodhisattva. Thus, the small town is believed to be the most sacred place for Buddhists. Formerly known as
Sambodhi, the city still holds evidence of Ashoka's contribution to commemorate Buddha's enlightenment and preach Buddhism. The small city holds several
mysteries which leaves even historians mesmerised.

								The history of Kolkata is intimately related with its invention during the British rule dating back 300 years ago. Earlier known as Calcutta, it originated as a capital
of British India in 1960 when East India Company dominated the country. Struggling to develop during Britain?s power war, most of its essential developments
took place in the 17th and 18th century. Later in the 19th century, Kolkata become one of the central point of India?s freedom struggle and after the capital
shifted to New Delhi in 1911, it became a bustling port and the new cultural capital of India.
	<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Calcutta - The Cultural Capital of India</span><br><br><br>
	Kolkata is not called the 'City of Joy' for nothing. Once the administrative capital of India until 1912, the current capital of West Bengal is unocially India's cultural
capital. The beautiful conuence of both the native and the western culture can be found here, be it in the majestic charm of Fort William and Victoria Memorial,
or the aura of places like Dakshineswar Kali Mandir and Kalighat Mandir. Kolkata is equally famous for its cuisines. From the spicy sh curry to the mouthwatering Sandesh and rosogollas, Kolkata is a literal paradise for the foodies residing in India. Snacks like Kathi roll and puchkas (Bengali version of the famous
golgappas) are not far behind. However, this is not the end. The obsession for sports, primarily the cricket and soccer, and literature in this city is world famous.
No wonder why sleuths like Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi have their origins in Kolkata, apart from the crowd puller matches at Salt Lake Stadium and Eden
Gardens. Kolkata is also popular for its underground metro, the rst of its kind in India, and a must-visit if you're in Kolkata. For those, who visit the city at the
time of Durga Puja, the cultural heaven just descends here at this time. To sum up, nowhere will the essence of the culture in India seem as magical as in Kolkata.

							The name Darjeeling means the "the land of the thunderbolt", derived from the Tibet word "Dorje" meaning "thunder" and "ling" meaning ?piece of land?. Prior to
its acquisition by East India Company, Darjeeling used to be a part of Sikkim and even before that, a part of Nepal. In February 1829, a dispute broke out between
Nepal and Sikkim about their borders and hence, Lord William Bentinck- Governor General of India at the time, set out to resolve the situation. In the process, he
realised that the quaint hill town had strategic advantages for trade and military outpost. Later, it was also realised that the land was ideal for tea plantations. The
district underwent major development and became a major tourist attraction visited by the British ocials. It, therefore, earned itself the title of "Queen of hills".
After independence, the district was merged with West Bengal and since then is one of the most popular hill stations in India.
	<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Culture of Darjeeling</span><br><br><br>
	Darjeeling has a unique and diverse culture. The city is a home to mix immigrants from Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet, Bhutan and even Europe, due to work opportunities
in tea plantations in the bygone era. Hinduism and Vajyarana Buddhism are the main religions of the people. One of the major festivals of Darjeeling is Losar,
primarily their new year, which is celebrated in January or February depending on the position of the moon (lunar calendar). Darjeeling Carnival is another major
festival held annually. The fair involves a display of folk dance and arts. Local rock bands participate in the same. Other important festivals are Makar Sankranti,
Chotrul Duchen (Buddhist festival commemorating the four events in the life of Gautam Buddha), Tendong Lho Rumfaat (Prayer of the Tendong mountain) etc.
