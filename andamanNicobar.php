The archipelago is divided into two groups of islands - the Andaman Islands and the Nicobar Islands. Of these, only 9 islands in the Andaman Islands group are
open for tourists. In earlier times, the islands were referred to as Kalapani for their notorious penal settlement. Pristine beaches, gorgeous corals, fascinating
marine life, adventurous water sports and the remain of Stone Age culture draw multitudes of tourists to these islands every year. These islands are covered
with lush forests and endless varieties of exotic ora and fauna. Incredible corals and marine life, crystal clear water and mangrove-lined creeks lure travellers
to these picturesque islands. while the sandy beaches form as nesting homes to turtles, animals such as spotted deer, wild boar, gecko, crab-eating macaque
and python can be spotted in the 86% area still covered by dense forests.

									<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History Of Andaman</span><br><br><br>
								Some of the earliest archaeological pieces of evidence suggest that the inhabitation of the islands dates back to 800 BC, which was sometime during the middle
Palaeolithic age. The islands were occupied mostly by the tribes called as Andamanese and others including Jharwas, Onges, Shompens and Sentenelese. Initially,
the empire was used by the Chola dynasty as a strategic naval base for an expedition against Sriwijiya Empire in Indonesia. Later it became a colony of the Danish,
and they named it Danish East India Company. Soon after, the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of epidemics, mostly malaria. Later, the
British set up their colony in Port Blair and bought the island from the Danish. Finally, when the British left India, the islands became a part of India in 1950 and
were declared a Union Territory in 1956.
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Indigenious Tribes Of Andaman</span><br><br><br>
	The Great Andamanese, Jarawas or Sentalenese are considered the rst people or natives of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They inhabit the South Andaman
and Middle Andaman Islands and live in groups and are known to be dark-skinned. They have shunned interactions with outside communities and mostly keep to
themselves. They have been inhabiting the islands for the last several thousand years. Most of them have now been wiped out by diseases, epidemics and
tsunamis and there are approx. Only 400-450 indigenous people are remaining on the islands. They resort to hunting-gathering lifestyle.
