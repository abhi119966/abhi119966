									<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History Of Andaman</span><br><br><br>
								Some of the earliest archaeological pieces of evidence suggest that the inhabitation of the islands dates back to 800 BC, which was sometime during the middle
Palaeolithic age. The islands were occupied mostly by the tribes called as Andamanese and others including Jharwas, Onges, Shompens and Sentenelese. Initially,
the empire was used by the Chola dynasty as a strategic naval base for an expedition against Sriwijiya Empire in Indonesia. Later it became a colony of the Danish,
and they named it Danish East India Company. Soon after, the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of epidemics, mostly malaria. Later, the
British set up their colony in Port Blair and bought the island from the Danish. Finally, when the British left India, the islands became a part of India in 1950 and
were declared a Union Territory in 1956.
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Indigenious Tribes Of Andaman</span><br><br><br>
	The Great Andamanese, Jarawas or Sentalenese are considered the rst people or natives of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They inhabit the South Andaman
and Middle Andaman Islands and live in groups and are known to be dark-skinned. They have shunned interactions with outside communities and mostly keep to
themselves. They have been inhabiting the islands for the last several thousand years. Most of them have now been wiped out by diseases, epidemics and
tsunamis and there are approx. Only 400-450 indigenous people are remaining on the islands. They resort to hunting-gathering lifestyle.
<br><br><br>
<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Perfect Beach Holiday</span><br><br><br>
Andamans have the most exotic beaches. These are Wandoor beach, Elephant Beach, Sitapur Beach, Bharatpur Beach, Laxmanpur Beach and Radhanagar Beach.
Each of these beaches oers a peaceful ambience that would make you want to spend days here. These beaches also give the opportunity of trying out a number
of water sports such as Scuba Diving, Snorkeling, Sea Walk etc.

								Mahabalipuram or Mamallapuram was once a trade city that was established during the Pallava dynasty. It became an important port and was a ourishing and
vibrant centre of activity. The Pallavas left behind a treasure-trove of history, architecture and culture in the form of stunning monoliths and rock temples, and
sculptures dedicated to the Gods. The history of this town stretches even beyond the 7th & 8th centuries and the Pallava dynasty; settlements belonging to the
pre-Sangam era and artefacts that predate the birth of Christ have also been found here. There is thus an air of mystery surrounding Mahabalipuram?s history,
with historians being unclear about the exact origins and roots of this popular tourist destination.

	Mahabalipuram is famous for its architectural wonders. These monuments, revering the various Gods and holy scriptures of the Hindu religion, are mainly in the
form of temples, rock-cut caves and other stone inscriptions. These monuments are classied into ve major forms - the Rathas or chariot temples, Mandapas or
cave temples, rock relief structures, structural temples and excavations. The Rathas are found in the southern part of the town, the most famous being the Panch
Rathas, dedicated to the 5 Pandava brothers from the Mahabharata. The Mandapas were historically places for social gatherings to take place. They have
excavated caves depicting various intricate carvings from Hindu mythology. Among the temples, the Shore temple located along the sea is the most popular,
mainly dedicated to the Lords Shiva and Vishnu. Rock reliefs, as the name suggests, are carved on independent rocks or big stones. The rock relief structure,
Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna?s penance, is believed to be one of the largest in the world and is carved on two large boulders 27m long and 9m high.
