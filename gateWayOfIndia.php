								<div class="placeTourismAbout">The Gateway of India is, without doubt, one of the most popular
								tourist hotspots of Mumbai. It is located at Apollo Bunder Waterfront and overlooks the Arabian Sea 
								in the most beautiful way. One of the most distinguished monuments in Mumbai, it was built in the year 
								1924 by famous architect George Wittet as a commemoration of the visit of King George V and Queen Mary 
								to Mumbai. The imposing structure of the monument is a beautiful confluence of Indian, Arabic and 
								Western architecture and has become a popular tourist hub in the city.

				<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History of Gateway of India</span><br><br><br>
								The land on which the Gateway now stands once belonged to a jetty that was primarily used by the fishing community of the area. 
								Seeing its viability as a landing area, it was renovated to serve as a pier for British governors. Soon enough,
								it was decided that a grand gateway will be built here to welcome King George V and Queen Mary to
								Mumbai, and the foundation of the same was laid down March 31, 1913, by the Governor of Bombay, Sir 
								George Sydenham Clarke. However, the final design of the Gateway was only sanctioned on March 31, 1914,
								by George Wittet. The constructions formally began in 1920 and it took almost four years to complete 
								the construction of the monument. On 4 December 1924, the Gateway of India was inaugurated by the 
								Viceroy, the Earl of Reading.

	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Design and Structure of Gateway of India</span><br><br><br>
	Built in Indo Saracenic style, the Gateway of India was designed by Scottish architect George Wittet. The design is a combination
	of Hindu and Muslim architectural influences along with a Roman triumphal arch, which stands at a height of 26 metres. It is built
	of yellow basalt and concrete and the stone was sourced locally. The arch is flanked by two large hallways that have the capacity 
	to accommodate as many as 600 people. On the other hand, the central dome of the gateway is inspired from Muslim architecture style
	and has a diameter of 48 feet with the apex reaching 83 feet. The gateway also has meticulously designed honeycomb structures which 
	further support four spires that grant a unique symmetry to the facade. Steps behind the archway give an expansive view of the
	Arabian Sea as well.
