The Capital city of India and the base location to explore North India, Delhi is considered to be the city with a heart.
New Delhi is a vivid blend of traditions, cultural diversity, political importance as well as architectural brilliance. It bridges its historical glory with the current
modern era. It is a popular tourist spot and also houses multiple theatres and centres of performing arts. Delhi's architectural brilliance can be traced as back
as 4th century AD when the Iron Pillar was built in the Mehrauli area, which hasn't shown any sign of rusting yet. The Qutub Minar, India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhawan ,Delhi has numerous monuments
showcasing both architectural and historical magnicence. ISKCON Temple, Akshardham Temple and the Lotus temple
 are some other beautiful buildings here. However, Delhi's magic lies in the Chandni
Chowk  area near the Jama Masjid  with the old bazaars bustling and chirping with thousands of visitors haggling with vendors to buy things at the cheapest rate
possible. Delhi's food is equally important to describe why people keep coming back to this wonderful city. From 5 star hotels and restaurants to the Parathe
Wali Gali, Delhi has an amazing food culture and if you are not used to Indian street food, you might also get to suer from Delhi Belly, but it might be just
worth it.

								The history of Jaipur is immersed in the quest of making it the most protected and powerful capital of its time. The city itself is named after the king who founded
it in 1727, Maharaja Jai Singh II; he decided to shift his state?s capital city from Amber to present-day Jaipur due to scarce basic amenities and consistently growing
population. He wanted his new capital to be so scientically, culturally, and architecturally accurate that the science and mathematics acionado took help from a
Bengali Brahmin scholar Vidyadhar Bhattacharya to construct a Vastu Shastra compliant city over the course of four years. The most advanced and fortied layout
of the city was made, with two out of the nine blocks reserved for palaces and administrative buildings and the rest for the public. The reason behind Jaipur being
called ?The Pink City? is also an interesting one: The whole city was quite literally dipped in pink paint to welcome the Prince of Wales in 1856 and to continue its
otherworldly magical charm, the pink colour is still maintained to this day. Jaipur is, in fact, India?s rst ever planned city, and is therefore rightly translated as the
?City of Victory?.
	<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Nightlife In Jaipur</span><br><br><br>
	s stately, sophisticated and regal Jaipur looks at day, it takes up a whole new avatar at night! The nightlife of Jaipur may not be like Goa?s, but it is nonetheless
adventurous and fun. If drinking and lounging with friends accompanied by great food and music are your sense of nirvana, then bars and pubs such as Aza, The
Grunge Lounge Bar, Bar Palladio, are your stairways to heaven. If you need to blow o some steam by dancing your heart out on the dancing oor, then Jaipur
nightlife has got you covered. Blackout, The Dragon Club (T.D.C), The Extreme Discotheque are perfect places to let your wild side show, costing you an
approximate average of INR 1500 for two, an aordable price for the amazing vibe they have got to offer!

nagar? which was a local alteration of ?Surya ? nagar? or City of Sun. King Pravarasena II found this city 2000 years ago, formerly named Parvasenpur. Soon it
became a part of the Mughal Empire, one of the largest Empires on India at that time. After the disintegration of Mughals, Srinagar was under the control of
Durranis who ruled for several decades on the valley. In 1947, the struggle to gain dominance over Srinagar started between India and Pakistan. This led to the
beginning of the Indo ? Pak War. United Nations started cease re on the situation due to which some parts of Kashmir went into the territory which is now called
?Azad Kashmir?. The rest of the territory is an integral part of India and tells its story through the glorious beauty of its land to all the travellers.
