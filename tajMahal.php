								<div class="placeTourismAbout">What is widely considered as the most beautiful building in the world, Taj Mahal is located in the historical city of Agra. Called as the "symbol of love", it was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Every year visitors numbering more than the entire population of Agra passes through the magnificent gates to catch a glimpse of this breathtaking monument, and only a few leave disappointed. Shah Jahan said about the Taj that it made "the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes".

The Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of Palaces in the Persian language. It rises from the dust-beaten earth of Uttar Pradesh, but even the wildest imaginations leave visitors underprepared for this world wonder. It is a breath stealing moment when the gates of this monument are traversed, and the Taj Mahal comes into focus. It is considered as the finest example of Mughal architecture and is now a UNESCO world heritage site.

				<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History of Taj Mahal</span><br><br><br>
								The Taj Mahal was built as a mausoleum by Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, 
								who died while giving birth to their 14th child in 1631. Her death left the emperor 
								completely heartbroken, and his hair is said to have turned grey overnight. The construction 
								of the Taj began in 1632. Th main building was completed in eight years, but the whole complex 
								was not completed until 1653. Soon after the construction was completed, Shah Jahan was overthrown 
								by his son Aurangzeb and imprisoned in the Agra Fort. For the rest of his life, he could only gaze 
								at his wondrous creation through a window. Shah Jahan died in 1666, after which his mortal remains 
								were buried here alongside Mumtaz. 

Over 20,000 people from all over Indian and Central Asia worked on this striking building. 
Specialists were brought from as far away as Europe who produced the beautiful marble screens and marble inlay (pietra dura) 
which is made of thousands of semi precious stones. Taj Mahal was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983. It 
looks as pristine today as it was first constructed. The monument underwent a massive restoration project in the early 20th century.

	The Taj Mahal can be accessed through east, west and south gates. Inside the grounds, the ornamental 
	gardens are set on the classic Mughal charbagh lines (formal Persian garden). The monument stands on a 
	raised marble platform at the northern end of the garden, facing its back to the Yamuna River. Its raised 
	position is a masterstroke design as it leaves the sky as its only backdrop. Each corner of the platform is
	graced with 40m high white minarets. Taj itself is made of semi-translucent white marble, inlaid with thousands
	of semi precious stones and carved with flowers. The four indistinguishable faces of the Taj are in perfect 
	symmetry, featuring impressive vaulted arches containing pietra dura scrollwork and the quotations from the Quran.
	The whole structure is topped off by four small domes.
