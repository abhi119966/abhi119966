								Much like the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the history of the town. It remained a small boondock until after the construction of Enchey Monastery of
Buddhist teachings in 1840 which made it a pilgrimage centre. It became a prominent town after the British invasion and then became the centre for trade
between Tibet and British India. Most of the roads were built during this time, the infrastructure was improved, and the telegraph system was modied.
Following India?s independence in 1947. Gangtok remained an independent monarchy, and a treaty was signed between King Chogyal and the then Prime
Minister of India- Jawaharlal Nehru, to follow the monarch rule. The state and its capital did not follow the democratic rule.
Finally in 1975, after decades of political uncertainties, struggles and riots, the monarchy was abrogated, and Sikkim became the twenty-second state of India with
Gangtok as its ocial capital
<br><br><br>	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Culture</span><br><br><br>
	Gangtok is inhabited by people from dierent ethnicities including Nepalese, Bhutias, and Lepchas. These various religious groups and communities keep the
