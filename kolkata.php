				<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History of Calcutta</span><br><br><br>
								The history of Kolkata is intimately related with its invention during the British rule dating back 300 years ago. Earlier known as Calcutta, it originated as a capital
of British India in 1960 when East India Company dominated the country. Struggling to develop during Britain?s power war, most of its essential developments
took place in the 17th and 18th century. Later in the 19th century, Kolkata become one of the central point of India?s freedom struggle and after the capital
shifted to New Delhi in 1911, it became a bustling port and the new cultural capital of India.

	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Calcutta - The Cultural Capital of India</span><br><br><br>
	Kolkata is not called the 'City of Joy' for nothing. Once the administrative capital of India until 1912, the current capital of West Bengal is unocially India's cultural
capital. The beautiful conuence of both the native and the western culture can be found here, be it in the majestic charm of Fort William and Victoria Memorial,
or the aura of places like Dakshineswar Kali Mandir and Kalighat Mandir. Kolkata is equally famous for its cuisines. From the spicy sh curry to the mouthwatering Sandesh and rosogollas, Kolkata is a literal paradise for the foodies residing in India. Snacks like Kathi roll and puchkas (Bengali version of the famous
golgappas) are not far behind. However, this is not the end. The obsession for sports, primarily the cricket and soccer, and literature in this city is world famous.
No wonder why sleuths like Feluda and Byomkesh Bakshi have their origins in Kolkata, apart from the crowd puller matches at Salt Lake Stadium and Eden
Gardens. Kolkata is also popular for its underground metro, the rst of its kind in India, and a must-visit if you're in Kolkata. For those, who visit the city at the
time of Durga Puja, the cultural heaven just descends here at this time. To sum up, nowhere will the essence of the culture in India seem as magical as in Kolkata.
