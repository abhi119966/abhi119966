								</div><!---- end of placeTourismName------------------->
								
								<div class="placeTourismAbout">The Red Fort is a historical fortification in the national capital of New Delhi. 
								Located in the center of the city, it was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal dynasty. It was constructed 
								by Shah Jahan in the year 1939 as a result of a capital shift from Agra to Delhi. This imposing piece of architecture
								derives its name from its impregnable red sandstone walls. In addition to accommodating the emperors
								and their households, it was the ceremonial and political center of the Mughal state and the setting 
								for events critically impacting the region. Today, this monument is home to a number of museums that
								have an assortment of precious artifacts on display.  Every year, the Indian Prime Minister unfurls 
								the national flag here on the Independence Day.

				<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History of Red Fort</span><br><br><br>
								The construction of Red Fort began in the holy month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638. It took nine years to build, and under the supervision of Shahjahan, the Fort was completed on 6 April 1648. To contain the older Salimgarh Fort inside its boundaries, the walls were built asymmetrical, unlike any other Mughal buildings. 

It remained the seat of Imperial Mughal Rule till 1857 when the Great Revolt took place. It consists of several other structures which were built during Shah Jahan's life, and some which were added by the later rulers. His son and successor Aurangzeb, added the Pearl Mosque or the Moti Masjid to the fort complex when he took over as the emperor after a fierce War of succession between him and his three brothers.

	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Architecture of Red Fort</span><br><br><br>
	Combining features of Indian, Persian and Timurid forms of architecture, the Red Fort is truly a monument par excellence. The architect of the Red Fort was Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, who also designed the Taj Mahal. It is surrounded by a 2 km perimeter wall which acted as an effective defensive measure. The structure of the fort is octagonal, and it has several gates, the prominent ones being Lahori, Ajmeri, Kashmiri, Mori, Turkman and Delhi gates. 

The Red Fort houses several structures inside its premises. The most well known among all these are the Diwan-i-Aam, the Diwan-i-Khaas, the Moti Masjid and the Nahr-i-Bashisht (stream of paradise).
