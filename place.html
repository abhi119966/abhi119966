good, the bad and the ugly'.
The Capital city of India and the base location to explore North India, Delhi is considered to be the city with a heart.
New Delhi is a vivid blend of traditions, cultural diversity, political importance as well as architectural brilliance. It bridges its historical glory with the current
modern era. It is a popular tourist spot and also houses multiple theatres and centres of performing arts. Delhi's architectural brilliance can be traced as back
as 4th century AD when the Iron Pillar was built in the Mehrauli area, which hasn't shown any sign of rusting yet. The Qutub Minar, India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhawan ,Delhi has numerous monuments
showcasing both architectural and historical magnicence. ISKCON Temple, Akshardham Temple and the Lotus temple
 are some other beautiful buildings here. However, Delhi's magic lies in the Chandni
Chowk  area near the Jama Masjid  with the old bazaars bustling and chirping with thousands of visitors haggling with vendors to buy things at the cheapest rate
possible. Delhi's food is equally important to describe why people keep coming back to this wonderful city. From 5 star hotels and restaurants to the Parathe
Wali Gali, Delhi has an amazing food culture and if you are not used to Indian street food, you might also get to suer from Delhi Belly, but it might be just
worth it.

								The history of Jaipur is immersed in the quest of making it the most protected and powerful capital of its time. The city itself is named after the king who founded
it in 1727, Maharaja Jai Singh II; he decided to shift his state?s capital city from Amber to present-day Jaipur due to scarce basic amenities and consistently growing
population. He wanted his new capital to be so scientically, culturally, and architecturally accurate that the science and mathematics acionado took help from a
Bengali Brahmin scholar Vidyadhar Bhattacharya to construct a Vastu Shastra compliant city over the course of four years. The most advanced and fortied layout
of the city was made, with two out of the nine blocks reserved for palaces and administrative buildings and the rest for the public. The reason behind Jaipur being
called ?The Pink City? is also an interesting one: The whole city was quite literally dipped in pink paint to welcome the Prince of Wales in 1856 and to continue its
otherworldly magical charm, the pink colour is still maintained to this day. Jaipur is, in fact, India?s rst ever planned city, and is therefore rightly translated as the
?City of Victory?.
	<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Nightlife In Jaipur</span><br><br><br>
	s stately, sophisticated and regal Jaipur looks at day, it takes up a whole new avatar at night! The nightlife of Jaipur may not be like Goa?s, but it is nonetheless
adventurous and fun. If drinking and lounging with friends accompanied by great food and music are your sense of nirvana, then bars and pubs such as Aza, The
Grunge Lounge Bar, Bar Palladio, are your stairways to heaven. If you need to blow o some steam by dancing your heart out on the dancing oor, then Jaipur
nightlife has got you covered. Blackout, The Dragon Club (T.D.C), The Extreme Discotheque are perfect places to let your wild side show, costing you an
approximate average of INR 1500 for two, an aordable price for the amazing vibe they have got to offer!

Bounded by two of the world's mightiest mountain ranges, the Great Himalaya and the Karakoram, it lies athwart two other, the Ladakh range and the Zanskar
range. Ladakh is mystical in all the spheres it covers, from nature, geography, sceneries to the modest cultures that it fosters. Right from gompas to the
sensational momos, the superabundance of attractions to visit makes this city make it heaven on earth. It is said that only in Ladakh can a man sitting in the

For those of us living in the constant confusion about the dierence between these twin locations, Leh-Ladakh, here is something that might help you. The state
of Jammu and Kashmir is divided into three parts: Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh. Ladakh, further is divided into two districts: district Leh, and district Kargil. The
former district has a popular town ?Leh?and is a great tourist attraction because of its beautiful monasteries, picturesque locations, and interesting markets

were oered the seven islands that made up Bombay by the Sultan. The islands were initially referred to by several dierent names, but collectively took the
written name of Bombain. The Portuguese built several churches and forts in the city during their reign. With its growing strategic importance as a natural
harbour, it attracted repeated British and Dutch interests. In 1661, as part of the royal marriage alliance between Charles II of England and Princess Catherine of
Portugal, the islands were given as dowry to the British by the Portuguese. In 1668, the English leased 3 of the islands to the British East India Company, and a few
years later, they shifted their capital from Surat to Bombay. Bombay was thus the capital of the Bombay Presidency and quickly gained commercial and military
signicance. The Portuguese nally left Bombay in the 1730s, following their defeat to the Marathas under Peshwa Baji Rao. Following the Anglo-Maratha war and
the signing of some treaties, the British drove out the Marathas and were able to establish their majoritarian supremacy over Bombay. Under the Hornby Vellard
project, the islands were unied through signicant land reclamation activities into a single landmass. Bombay was extremely active in the political sphere during
India?s independence struggle and was part of the Quit India Movement & the Royal Navy Mutiny in the 1940s.

								<div class="placeTourismAbout">Neatly tucked into the Western coast of India, Goa is the state associated most with touristy beaches, a happening nightlife and over 300-year old Portuguese
architecture. Referred to as the city of churches by many, the culture of Goa has the lingering effect of being a Portugal colony. Visibly different from the rest of the country, Goa has
characteristic colourful houses, lush green fields and a soothing languidness in the atmosphere. The charming villages of Goa are ideal for a laidback morning walk or an
aimless evening stroll. North and South regions of the place are strikingly different - the former is a cultural hub with traditional eateries and markets, while the latter
makes for an idyllic vacation with its 5-star hotels, private beaches and a mix of white sand and clear blue water. Under the star-laden skies, each festivity becomes more
alive. Goa greens and wildlife makes for a nature lover's ideal hotspot. If you are a food adventurer, you may want to visit the gorgeous spice gardens and try a glassful of
cashew feni. Goa provides a respite, not just for the tourists on an appointment with nature, it is also the place for crazy parties and a vivacious night-life. The ultimate
tourist destination of India, Goa promises to be something special for all types of travellers.

	Goa, in the Hindu Scriptures, has been named as Gomanta which means the region of cows. It is believed that Parashurama, the sixth reincarnation of Lord
Vishnu was the creator of the Goan region. A legend says that he along with ten sages had performed re sacrices in the lands of Goa. The gist of Sanskritisation
in Goa's culture is said to be originated with the settlement of Parashurama and the sages from North following whom the people of Goa carry Brahminical
hegemony. Walking down the lane of its History we come across another legend according to which Goa is considered sacred for its spiritually cleansing touch.

									<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">History Of Andaman</span><br><br><br>
								Some of the earliest archaeological pieces of evidence suggest that the inhabitation of the islands dates back to 800 BC, which was sometime during the middle
Palaeolithic age. The islands were occupied mostly by the tribes called as Andamanese and others including Jharwas, Onges, Shompens and Sentenelese. Initially,
the empire was used by the Chola dynasty as a strategic naval base for an expedition against Sriwijiya Empire in Indonesia. Later it became a colony of the Danish,
and they named it Danish East India Company. Soon after, the islands were repeatedly abandoned due to outbreaks of epidemics, mostly malaria. Later, the
British set up their colony in Port Blair and bought the island from the Danish. Finally, when the British left India, the islands became a part of India in 1950 and
were declared a Union Territory in 1956.
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Indigenious Tribes Of Andaman</span><br><br><br>
	The Great Andamanese, Jarawas or Sentalenese are considered the rst people or natives of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They inhabit the South Andaman
and Middle Andaman Islands and live in groups and are known to be dark-skinned. They have shunned interactions with outside communities and mostly keep to
themselves. They have been inhabiting the islands for the last several thousand years. Most of them have now been wiped out by diseases, epidemics and
tsunamis and there are approx. Only 400-450 indigenous people are remaining on the islands. They resort to hunting-gathering lifestyle.

This city was the capital of Tripura Kingdom in the 10th century and was ruled by the Hayahya. Many relics from the reign of King Ashoka were discovered in here.
In the 16th century, the city was ruled by the Gonds and then taken over by the Marathas in the 17th century. The British defeated the Marathas in the 19th
century and made Jabalpur the headquarter of Nerbudda territories. It also became the capital of Saugor which is the present day Sagar District and Nerbudda
District. After Independence, the cantonment in the city was dedicated to army training and a vehicle factory and a gun carriage factory were also established.
Once a part of the Gond empire, the history of Jabalpur, inspired by gures like Rani Durgavati is a strong evidence of the strength of Indian women. Jabalpur not
only mesmerizes us through the beauty of the Kalachuri art and unique constructions like the Madan Mahal Fort but also reminds of the sacrice of Mahatma
Gandhi whose remains were immersed in the Narmada in Tilwara Ghat amidst pure marble on both sides. A great deal of importance was given to make this city

controlling the Vindhyachal mountain ranges was worshipping Lord Shiva to cleanse his soul of the sins committed by him. He made a lingam of sand and clay.
Impressed by the worship, Lord Shiva appeared before him in two forms- Omkareshwar and Amkareshwar. The second legend suggests that an ancestor of Lord
Ram- King Mandhata, worshipped Lord Shiva to the extent that the God appeared and manifested himself in the form of Jyotirlinga. Another Hindu myth says that
once during the ancient times, there was a war between the Devas(gods) and Danavs(demons), in which the Devas lost the battle to the Danavs. Disappointed by
the failure, the Devas prayed to Lord Shiva, who impressed by their faith and devotion, appeared in the form of Jyotirlinga and defeated the Danavs.

temple on the land. As per theory, Buddha was born in 563 BC in a land which now belongs to Nepal, on the auspicious night of Baisakhi Purnima. Born as the
son of a king, Prince Siddhartha renounced his world possessions at the age of 29 and travelled far and wide in search of the eternal truth. After observing selfmortication for 6 years, he did not attain Vimukthi so he gave up the practice. He then discovered the Eightfold path which freed him from lust, hatred and
delusion and thus attained enlightenment or ?Buddhatva?. The tree under which he gained enlightenment is the renowned Bodhi tree. He gained numerous
followers in the days to follow and the village turned into a pilgrimage centre. Emperor Ashoka himself was one of his biggest disciples and he built the famous
Mahabodhi temple. The sacred village gained momentum around the 13th century and plenty of shrines and temples were built. But soon after the area fell into
the hands of the brutal Turkish emperors and they ransacked the city. The British rule later restored the city to its pure sacred form. At present, the city is one of
the most important Buddhist pilgrim sites and is declared as world heritage site by UNESCO.

							The name Darjeeling means the "the land of the thunderbolt", derived from the Tibet word "Dorje" meaning "thunder" and "ling" meaning ?piece of land?. Prior to
its acquisition by East India Company, Darjeeling used to be a part of Sikkim and even before that, a part of Nepal. In February 1829, a dispute broke out between
Nepal and Sikkim about their borders and hence, Lord William Bentinck- Governor General of India at the time, set out to resolve the situation. In the process, he
realised that the quaint hill town had strategic advantages for trade and military outpost. Later, it was also realised that the land was ideal for tea plantations. The
district underwent major development and became a major tourist attraction visited by the British ocials. It, therefore, earned itself the title of "Queen of hills".
After independence, the district was merged with West Bengal and since then is one of the most popular hill stations in India.
	<br><br><br>
	<span class="historyDescriptionHeadingstyle">Culture of Darjeeling</span><br><br><br>
	Darjeeling has a unique and diverse culture. The city is a home to mix immigrants from Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet, Bhutan and even Europe, due to work opportunities
in tea plantations in the bygone era. Hinduism and Vajyarana Buddhism are the main religions of the people. One of the major festivals of Darjeeling is Losar,
primarily their new year, which is celebrated in January or February depending on the position of the moon (lunar calendar). Darjeeling Carnival is another major
festival held annually. The fair involves a display of folk dance and arts. Local rock bands participate in the same. Other important festivals are Makar Sankranti,
Chotrul Duchen (Buddhist festival commemorating the four events in the life of Gautam Buddha), Tendong Lho Rumfaat (Prayer of the Tendong mountain) etc.

between Tibet and British India. Most of the roads were built during this time, the infrastructure was improved, and the telegraph system was modied.
Following India?s independence in 1947. Gangtok remained an independent monarchy, and a treaty was signed between King Chogyal and the then Prime
Minister of India- Jawaharlal Nehru, to follow the monarch rule. The state and its capital did not follow the democratic rule.
Finally in 1975, after decades of political uncertainties, struggles and riots, the monarchy was abrogated, and Sikkim became the twenty-second state of India with
Gangtok as its ocial capital
